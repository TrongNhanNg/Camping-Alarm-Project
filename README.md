# Project name: CAMPING ALARM
# Description: 
This project create a device to detect motion in 6 direction and print the direction on on screen as well as play the warning sound inform the direction got the motion. With 6 PIR sensors being waterproofed to be able withstand hard raining and mist.
# Preparation:
- Hardware: 1x Arduino Nano, 6x HW-416 PIR sensors, 1x 16x2 LCD display, 1x Buzzer, 1x LED
- Software: Arduino IDE
# How to use:
Upload the code to Arduino Nano, setting up 6 PIR sensors in 6 direction and plug in the board with backup phone charger and its ready to detect motion.
